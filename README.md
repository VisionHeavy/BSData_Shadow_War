Battlescribe data for Shadow War: Armageddon

Its a rough start for the Shadow War: Armageddon Battlescribe data, but it works for the most part.

-Pages and books need to be added to almost every still, was trying to make stuff quickly to have it done for Friday to be able to use. At least to be able to make lists.

I will get a host set up for the .bsi hopefully on Friday, or when all facations have their first release out.
